# Data Science Jobs

In this project, all 20,000 data science jobs from Glassdoor were scraped and used to perform in depth analysis into the job market for data science. Individual skills, software, and qualification were analyzed using frequency and associated salaries to determine the value of different attributes from the point of view of the employer. A paper was also produced using this data and analysis and is under review for publication at the Data Science Journal.
